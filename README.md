## Personal Comments 
It was amazing to work on this task over the weekend. I spent around 4â€“5 hours fine-tuning the initial solution to match the requirements. I'm not usually a test person (I often delegate such tasks), but I learned a lot of new things. Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
